There is no wheel (prebuilt package) for Python 3.7 on Windows (there is one for Python 2.7 and 3.4 up to 3.6) 
so you need to prepare build environment on your PC to use this package. Easier would be finding the wheel for 3.7 
as some packages are quite hard to build on Windows.

step0. look your python version and build (mine at installation 3.7 , build 32)
step1. download suitable wheel(.whl) file

step2. pip install <downloaded file>
